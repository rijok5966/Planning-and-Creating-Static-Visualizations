# Planning and Creating Static Visualizations

Project Overview:

Background Visualisation software, such as Tableau and Power B.I, implement visualisation principles in the default creation of visuals. The defaults used in these programs are generic and have cultural and context biases that are typically not useful in the specific application of your visuals. For example, if you are designing a visual targeted towards an environmental group, the program visual defaults need to be changed to suit a “green” focus. 

Altering visualisation requires knowledge of visualisation principles and theories which you will need to apply. Additional to changing the default appearance of a visualisation, is the target design of the visual to communicate data. The formal planning process to be applied is the What, Why, How framework Visuals resulting from a formal planning process are more effective at communicating a message from the data to a specific audience.  
 
This project aims to : 

--> Demonstrate sound knowledge of the basic theory, principles and concepts that underpin data visualisation techniques and strategies.

--> Apply related Visualisation principles and approaches to analyse, evaluate and improve visualisation.

--> Plan and communicate static visualisations using a formal planning process.
